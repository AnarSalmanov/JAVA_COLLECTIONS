	 * List is Interface of Collection framework
	 * ArrayList and LinkedList and Vector class implements to List interface.
	 * 
	 * 
	 *               ArrayList VS LinkedList VS Vector
	 * They are pretty much same.
	 * ArrayList implemant only List Interface.Array based. Not thread safe.
	 * Faster in get methods
	 *      
	 * LinkedList implements List and DeQUe Interfaces. Not thread safe
	 * Faster in add and remove methods.(also have extra mthods addFirst(),addLast(),getFirst(),getLast())
	 *      
	 * Vector implements to List Interface .Array based. Thread safe, synchronized.
	 * Mostly used in multythreaded environment.
	 * This is the slowest data stracture.
