	 * Set - ic collection of unique/distinct values.
	 * Set does not have get(index) method.
	 * Because set maintains the adding randomly, not by adding order.
	 * Set does not allow dupplicate valueS, won't complain in compiling time but in Runtime will ignore the adding.
	 * will only add 1 time all duplicates will be ignored.
