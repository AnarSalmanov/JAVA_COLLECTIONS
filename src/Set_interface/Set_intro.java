     * Set - is collection of distinct values.
     * Only HashSet and LinkedHashSet allows 1 null value and never duplicate.
     * Set does not have get(index) method.
     * Because set maintains the adding randomly, not by adding order.
     * Only LinkedHashSet maintains elements by asserting order.
     * Set does not allow duplicate values, won't complain in compiling time but in
     runtime will ignore the adding will just override it.
